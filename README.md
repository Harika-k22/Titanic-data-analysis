The Titanic dataset analysis aims to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the Titanic.
The dataset contains various features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and port of embarkation, which help in exploring survival patterns. 
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values—most notably in the Age and Cabin columns—encoding categorical variables like Sex and Embarked,
and dropping irrelevant or high-cardinality features such as Name and Ticket. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed key insights: women and first-class passengers had higher survival rates,
and younger passengers were more likely to survive. Visualizations like heatmaps and boxplots were used to better understand data 
distribution and relationships. A logistic regression model was applied to predict survival, with the dataset split into training and test sets.
The model was evaluated using accuracy scores and confusion matrices. 
Overall, the analysis demonstrated that features such as gender, age, and class were strong predictors of survival,
showcasing how data science techniques can provide valuable insights from historical events.
